1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,120
Michael designs the new neighborhood.

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,224
The Bad Place gets to
choose the four new humans.

3
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:15,226
The other residents will be Janet Babies.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,186
You know, if we pooled our resources,

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,438
we could be done in two
shakes of a lamb's Derek.

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,607
Thanks, Derek.

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:21,857
<i>When you fail, the four humans</i>

8
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:23,359
<i>will be tortured for all eternity.</i>

9
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:25,444
<i>But guess who's going
to be doing the torturing?</i>

10
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:26,821
<i>We built a Michael suit.</i>

11
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:29,157
I can't do it. It's too scary.

12
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:32,410
- Hi, John, I'm the Architect.
Come on in.

13
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:34,777
<i>The Bad Place didn't
pick the worst people.</i>

14
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,707
They picked the people
who would be the worst for us.

15
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:40,919
You need to erase my
memory and reboot me.

16
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,838
Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor. Come on in.

17
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,469
Wow! Just... wow!

18
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:52,430
It's perfect. Everything is just perfect.

19
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:54,849
I am so, so happy.

20
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:56,434
I'm glad you like it.

21
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:58,853
It's so quaint... it feels cozy,

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,815
but also vibrant and limitless.

23
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,733
I can't believe how...
How utterly, completely,

24
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,693
100% perfect everything is...

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,027
You know, let's keep this moving.

26
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,655
Oh, yeah, sure.

27
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,949
Here is your new home,

28
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:12,616
complete with two
of your favorite things:

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,243
Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and...

30
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,412
Reading lights! I love reading lights.

31
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:17,621
They are great for reading.

32
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:19,624
Your magic philosophy library

33
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,918
contains every text ever written,

34
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,837
from Aristotle to Zeno.

35
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,923
And, oh, check this out.
Um, hold out your hand.

36
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,342
And think about a book.

37
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,722
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

38
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,725
I can summon philosophy
books like Thor's hammer.

39
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,351
This is literally my number one dream.

40
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,020
Also... ow!

41
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:42,605
That hurt.

42
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,566
Well, I have a lot to attend to.

43
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:46,609
Um... welcome to the Good Place, Chidi.

44
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:49,696
Thank you so much.
Ah... and I'm... I'm sorry.

45
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:52,782
This has been so overwhelming,
I-I forgot your name.

46
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:56,661
- Eleanor.
- Eleanor, right.

47
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:58,370
Sorry. Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.

48
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,554
- Now I'll never forget.
- Well, you might!

49
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,963
Okay, can we not...

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,882
Oh, Eleanor, you did a brave thing

51
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:12,218
and I am embracing you
and I shall not let you go.

52
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,887
And I'm also embracing you

53
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,681
because this feels warm
and my hands are cold.

54
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,766
Guys, I'm good. Honestly.

55
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,685
Wasn't even as bad as I thought.

56
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,937
I mean,
who cares if he doesn't remember my name?

57
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,857
Oof... I mean, cool.

58
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,901
Good save, bud.

59
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,403
Let's just concentrate
on the next resident,

60
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,448
who gets here in... six minutes.

61
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:35,408
Wait. I need to say something.

62
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,118
I know this seems bleak

63
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,120
and it feels like we're all doomed

64
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,414
and therefore humanity is doomed.

65
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,374
You needed to say that?

66
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,586
The point is,
I believe that we're destined to succeed.

67
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,253
There is nothing that the
Bad Place can throw at us

68
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,966
that we can't handle,
because we are an incredible,

69
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,177
inspiring, brilliant group of...

70
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,179
Supercharged, d-bag, ass-wiping maniacs.

71
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:58,765
I mean, look at you.

72
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:01,059
I am so proud

73
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:03,937
of how disgusting and cruel you all are.

74
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,773
You suck.

75
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,859
You all suck donkey butts.

76
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:13,863
Tahani...
so, so smart, and sophisticated.

77
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,155
She was the only one
who was able to talk me

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,658
out of that goatee.

79
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,659
Well,
I lost that battle with Robert Downey Jr.,

80
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,703
and I'll be damned if I lose it with you.

81
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:22,914
Bambadjan... such an unbelievable dingus.

82
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,041
- Aww, thanks, boss.
- And Val.

83
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,502
Who's a bigger skid mark than Val?

84
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:28,753
Maybe your mom.

85
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:32,507
Classic.

86
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:33,883
We have Janet,

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,761
who can do literally anything.

88
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:40,223
She made all the other
people in the neighborhood.

89
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,100
- Not people.
- We have me,

90
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:45,436
who had a momentary setback,
but I'm feeling great now.

91
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:46,812
And that was a while ago.

92
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,096
Most of you don't even remember it,
probably.

93
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,110
We have Jason,

94
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,486
who can...

95
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,700
And marching us into battle,

96
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,745
our fearless leader,
the pride of Phoenix, Arizona,

97
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,706
Eleanor Shellstrop!

98
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:06,165
- Yay, Eleanor!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

99
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,541
Technically, the pride of Phoenix

100
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,475
is a life-size statue of Alice Cooper

101
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,045
made from cigarette butts.

102
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,714
It's outside City Hall.

103
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,674
But thank you for the kind words.

104
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:16,509
With this team,

105
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,845
there's no problem we can't solve.

106
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,097
There is no problem we can't create.

107
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,851
And believe me,
we are gonna create some a-problems.

108
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,979
So let's kick things off with
our official Bad Place song.

109
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:31,315
♪ 1-877-KARS for Kids ♪

110
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:34,819
♪ K-A-R-S, Kars for Kids ♪

111
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:37,196
- Ooh, are we singing?
- Shut up, Glenn.

112
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,120
I think you look great.

113
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,706
Professional, serious.

114
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,291
A proper team leader.

115
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,583
It does make me feel authoritative,

116
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,544
like that chick from "Law and Order."

117
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,421
Well, boys,

118
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:56,883
looks like we got ourselves an SVU.

119
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:59,926
I've never seen the show.

120
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,013
Okay, who we got next?

121
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,268
Linda? Come on in.

122
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:10,438
So you, Linda Johannsen,

123
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,024
are in the Good Place.

124
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,777
That's nice.

125
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,861
I know this can be a little overwhelming,

126
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:20,114
but you'll get used to it.

127
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,199
Do you have any questions?

128
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:23,743
Is there a fitness center?

129
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,078
There can be,

130
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:28,081
plus literally anything else

131
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,041
you could possibly wish for.

132
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,085
Just in case we weren't clear,

133
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,003
this is the Good Place.

134
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,005
A state of eternal happiness.

135
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,925
Paradise.

136
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,051
That's nice.

137
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,845
I like that.

138
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,725
So the Bad Place sent
Simone to mess with Chidi,

139
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,977
John to mess with Tahani...
Do you think they sent Linda

140
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,146
to mess with Jason? She's from Norway...

141
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,732
Is Norway, like, the opposite of Florida?

142
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,349
All I know is she's boring.

143
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:57,634
She makes Neutral Janet

144
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,404
look like Disco Janet.

145
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:02,907
Disco Janet was around for a while,
years ago.

146
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,325
She was great.

147
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:05,325
I mean, she was a lot,

148
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,953
but she was fun.

149
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,579
Actually, that's a good idea.

150
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:09,830
Let's unload this dead weight.

151
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,040
Janet?

152
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,543
- Hi, there.
- Linda, this is Janet.

153
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,378
If you want anything at all,
Janet can bring it to you.

154
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,546
Watch.

155
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,799
Janet, can I have a baby elephant

156
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,342
made of pure light

157
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,637
that tells you true secrets
about the universe?

158
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,889
<i>Shirley Temple killed JFK.</i>

159
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,684
See? Anything you want from Janet?

160
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:31,811
Can I have

161
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:33,062
a peppermint?

162
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,772
Sure.

163
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:38,985
I'm gonna go over there now.

164
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:43,656
<i>Stonehenge was a sex thing.</i>

165
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,084
Brent? Come on in.

166
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:59,672
So you, Brent Norwalk, are dead.

167
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,049
Dead? Really?

168
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,551
Well, that blows.

169
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,385
Ah, you know what,
maybe it's a good thing, actually.

170
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,887
Some journalist was poking around,

171
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,347
calling all these ladies
who used to work for me.

172
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,598
You can't even make a joke these days!

173
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:11,225
Everything is so PC.

174
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:13,227
And I was an equal-opportunity offender,
okay?

175
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,813
I made jokes about everybody,
and by the way,

176
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,356
I'm the furthest thing from racist.

177
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,483
My dentist was a black woman.

178
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,550
I just think people need to loosen up.

179
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:23,029
So, where am I, exactly?

180
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:27,825
- The Good Place.
- Oh, cool.

181
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,326
Good.

182
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,454
So, Brent, I see from your file

183
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,371
you were in the materials business.

184
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,041
Oh, yeah, big time.

185
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,586
Strings, chords, vinyl,
synthetics, rubber...

186
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:40,671
We do vulcanized now, so that's huge.

187
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:43,758
Plus metals...
aluminum, brass, copper... what else...

188
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,801
- Steel?
- No, not steel.

189
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,303
Steel's a sucker's game.

190
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,054
Polymers, coatings, internals...

191
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:50,723
You crack open an HVAC?

192
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,558
That is all us.

193
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,434
Is there golf here?
There freaking better be.

194
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:57,271
Okay, well,
why don't you explore around a bit

195
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:59,481
while I go far away
and if you need anything,

196
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:00,774
you can always ask Janet.

197
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:01,776
Janet?

198
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,110
Hi, there. How can I help you?

199
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:04,946
Oh, a secretary. Great.

200
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:06,572
- Not a secretary.
- Fine, fine.

201
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,282
Executive assistant.

202
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,659
Here we go with all the
terms we gotta learn, right?

203
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:13,788
Vice-president of helping.
Captain Marvel.

204
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:16,415
- You know what I'm saying.
- Oh, I'm not part of this.

205
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,749
Let me show you around.

206
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,652
Well,
Linda must be here for Jason because

207
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:25,383
Brent is definitely here to
annoy the fork out of me.

208
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,427
Everyone,
you may remember Matt from accounting.

209
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:32,556
Used to be in charge of the
Weird Sex Things Department.

210
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,685
Now the Judge has
assigned him to our project.

211
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,436
And I am thrilled to be here.

212
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,605
I mean, the things I had to read about...

213
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,359
The things people put in other things...

214
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,070
So I'll be monitoring
the four new humans.

215
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,698
A modified point system
will be applied to their actions

216
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:51,116
for the next year,
and then we'll know how much

217
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,743
better or worse their behavior is

218
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,127
than when they were alive.

219
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,704
But no one will be able
to see what's happening

220
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:56,664
in real time.

221
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,748
Good luck saving humanity

222
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,417
from eternal doom.

223
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,465
Okay, forget about all that stuff.

224
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,593
For this first week,
all we need to do is figure out

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,595
what the fork is up with these benches.

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,764
So, I made this.

227
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:15,975
We start 'em out on this side,

228
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:18,227
because we're like, "What's her deal?"

229
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,147
And when we feel we have
a handle on who they are,

230
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:24,358
what makes them tick,
we move them to this side...

231
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:25,776
Party time.

232
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,736
We already know a lot about Simone

233
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,697
so

234
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:30,990
Boom, see?

235
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:32,450
One down, three to go.

236
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:33,951
Let's go figure out the others.

237
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:35,786
We can do this. On three.

238
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,539
Dead eyes, eat hearts, can't lose.

239
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:42,376
Ah, sorry. Old Bad Place rally cry.

240
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,879
Aww, aww.

241
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,673
Janet! He's walking around again.

242
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,509
Yeah, I see that.
Derek, what are you doing here?

243
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:51,885
You're supposed to stay at Mindy's.

244
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,220
I can't help it.

245
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,348
I'm just such a proud daddy Derek.

246
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,183
I mean, will you look at

247
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,059
all these beautiful babies that we made?

248
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:02,021
She made them, dude.
You barely did anything.

249
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:04,815
Probably just, like, made all the butts.

250
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:06,566
I did make all the butts.
I made that butt...

251
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,901
- I made that butt...
- Right.

252
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:09,820
I made both those butts.

253
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,072
Derek, you have to stay at Mindy's house.

254
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:14,199
What if one of our new
humans sees you and starts

255
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,034
asking questions about
the weirdo in the tux?

256
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:17,161
Say no more.

257
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,622
I shall remove myself forthwith,

258
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,083
with my pickled potable.

259
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,751
But before I leave,

260
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:27,630
can I have a hug in celebration
of everything that we created?

261
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,507
- Okay.
- Aww.

262
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:33,844
That feels so... Derek.

263
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,304
Oh.

264
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,766
<i>You are all, simply put, good people.</i>

265
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,351
The point of the video is
to make them all confront

266
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,437
what kind of people they were on earth.

267
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:46,399
Keep a close eye on our four subjects.

268
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,984
Try to gauge their reactions, you know?

269
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:53,364
The subtlest glances,
the tiniest flinches.

270
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,533
What about shaking someone by the head?

271
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,120
- What does that mean?
- Oh, boy.

272
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,455
Hey, Simone,

273
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:02,873
everything okay?

274
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,419
Yeah, well, no...
well, actually, it doesn't matter.

275
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:07,670
None of this is real.

276
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,004
Sorry?

277
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,088
I'm a neuroscientist,

278
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,966
so I get what's going on here.

279
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,551
You know, clearly,
I was in some kind of horrible accident,

280
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,511
I'm on my deathbed, and this entire thing

281
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:18,722
is just a hallucination
constructed by my damaged brain

282
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,057
as it slowly shuts down.

283
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:22,560
It's not real,
so I'm just gonna wander around

284
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:25,271
until I wake up or die.

285
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,488
See you later,
figments of my imagination!

286
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,403
She's just gonna go get some popcorn

287
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,072
from the... river.

288
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,439
There's a popcorn river.

289
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,117
I'll show you guys later.

290
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:40,702
Uh, she said keep going without her,
so let's roll it.

291
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,413
Janet, make a popcorn river.

292
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,124
Everyone else,
meet at Mindy's in ten minutes.

293
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,836
Well... we're off to a fantastic start.

294
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,630
I told the other humans
that adjusting to the afterlife

295
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,215
was tricky, blah, blah, blah.

296
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:54,424
Seemed like they bought it.

297
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,760
What if Simone is right, though?

298
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:59,096
What if we are just Thin
Mints of her imagination?

299
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,265
Jason, remember you're a monk.

300
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:02,933
Even here where no one can see?

301
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,142
Mm-hmm, sometimes, yeah.

302
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,394
I wish I could stay and help,

303
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:07,021
but this system is so complex

304
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,648
that if I lose concentration
for even one billionth

305
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,400
of a second, the entire neighborhood

306
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,195
could collapse in on
itself like a dying star.

307
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:16,780
Also, Brent wants a BLT.

308
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:19,074
Simone's reaction is fairly common.

309
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,701
When I worked in the Bad Place,
some people just wouldn't

310
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,495
believe it when they
heard they were dead.

311
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:24,663
How did you convince them?

312
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:25,997
They'd usually come around

313
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,874
by the third or fourth
day of mouth fleas.

314
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,169
Obviously not an option here.

315
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,337
But,
if Simone doesn't think this is real,

316
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,506
she definitely won't
become a better person.

317
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,217
Who can convince her that
this actually is the afterlife?

318
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,886
We need someone
authoritative and reassuring,

319
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,348
like...
Nelson Mandela or Sir Patrick Stewart

320
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,308
or Arianna Huffington.

321
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:46,560
Really any of my old
racquetball partners would do.

322
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:47,936
Oh, I know who it should be.

323
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,937
If you say Blake Bortles,

324
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,063
I'm gonna slap you a lot.

325
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:51,273
Chidi!

326
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,066
I believe everything Chidi ever tells me

327
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,734
because of his brain and how he looks

328
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:57,195
like one of those owls
that graduated from college.

329
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,447
Of course.

330
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,866
Time to activate our
ethical sleeper agent

331
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,952
and introduce him to Simone.

332
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:04,703
Eh, I don't know, Simone isn't struggling

333
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,121
with a philosophy problem.

334
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:10,042
She's just, you know, like...
being silly.

335
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,920
I'll talk to her.

336
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,923
Tahani, I need your advice.

337
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,050
Derek is trying to move in on Janet.

338
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,094
I can just feel it.

339
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,804
Jason, Janet might not have

340
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,597
as much time for you as she used to,

341
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,891
but your relationship's on solid ground.

342
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,602
What do Janet and Derek
have in common anyway?

343
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,649
I mean, she did create him
out of the essence of herself.

344
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:36,777
Okay, fine, they share one thing.

345
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,278
Everything.

346
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,614
But if Derek is trying
to get under your skin,

347
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,700
you just have to rise above it.

348
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:45,744
All my favorite things
rise above other things,

349
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,705
like private airships

350
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,665
or my own head.

351
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,503
Look, I know this can be disorienting.

352
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,673
Okay, one moment, you're on Earth, alive,

353
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,425
eating queso like it's soup

354
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,801
and trying to guess your
neighbor's Wi-Fi password,

355
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:04,680
and the next, you're here...

356
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:07,516
Your face feels so much like a face.

357
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:09,100
I'll take that as a compliment.

358
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,584
Look,
I wasn't a particularly religious person,

359
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,898
but...
this just doesn't feel like heaven.

360
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:18,152
It's much more likely that I'm in a coma,

361
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,028
and my brain has invented all this.

362
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:21,405
Like the flowers.

363
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:22,739
Those are probably
just the "get well" flowers

364
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:23,740
in my hospital room.

365
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,951
Man, I was popular.

366
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:30,080
Well,
I can promise you the Good Place is real.

367
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,582
Think about what I said.

368
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,542
And in the meantime,
there's a fun welcome party tonight.

369
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,960
Dress up.

370
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,713
Have Janet make you
whatever outfit you'd like.

371
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,839
Eleanor!

372
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,383
Look what my brain did!

373
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,469
It's not real and neither are you.

374
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:46,347
♪ I'm in a coma and
none of this is real ♪

375
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:49,183
Okay, I know this is bad
and we need a new approach,

376
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,978
but... she is wearing the
hell out of those foam fingers.

377
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,692
Roo-da-toot-toot

378
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,986
Dude! Janet told you to stay at Mindy's.

379
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,031
I know,
I just came to mix myself a Derek,

380
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,992
and then I'll be on my way.

381
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:11,037
Before you leave, I want to call a truce.

382
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:11,789
Derek?

383
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,047
Feel like you're trying to get
under my skin, but it's okay.

384
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,836
I've decided to rise above it.

385
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,797
Well spoken, Mr. Mendoza.

386
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,466
Let me say in response...

387
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,760
I will

388
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,637
destroy you.

389
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:30,391
Janet is, and always will be,

390
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,227
my mommy-girlfriend.

391
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:36,730
You have crossed the Rubicon now, pal.

392
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,319
Mmm...

393
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,737
Okay, status report.

394
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:45,363
What have we learned about Linda?

395
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,616
Little, I'm afraid...
I tried talking to her,

396
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,035
but it was the dullest
conversation I have ever had,

397
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,911
and this is coming from
someone who once split a Xanax

398
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,414
with Peter Sarsgaard.

399
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,180
Frankly, I'm glad she's boring.

400
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,167
We have enough to worry about.
How is Brent doing?

401
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:00,003
- About the same, I'd say.
- Princeton.

402
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,756
Graduated in the top half of
the bottom half of my class.

403
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,175
Rowing team, sailing team,
class president.

404
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,718
I hung out with all those guys.

405
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:09,763
Okay, and John,
our favorite gossip columnist?

406
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,973
Luckily, before I died, I pumped my face

407
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,224
with six vials of Juvederm.

408
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,225
I'm hoping that my corpse

409
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,894
looks like a waxed tile floor.

410
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,731
My ex-boyf is going to be supes jel.

411
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:20,273
Okay, well, I'm gonna do a loop.

412
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:21,692
Trying to see who gets me.

413
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,319
Our biggest liability
right now is Simone.

414
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,281
Let's try to keep the three
of them away from her.

415
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,617
We can't wait any longer.

416
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,911
We have to introduce Simone to Chidi.

417
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,497
Why? I-I think she's doing great.

418
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,792
See, she's getting all the cake-pushing

419
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,377
out of her system.

420
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:44,005
I know it's painful to
think of the two of them

421
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,843
connecting,
but Chidi made an incredible sacrifice.

422
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,430
He had his memories erased
so he could help people.

423
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,014
And if we don't let him help Simone,

424
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,350
it'll be all for nothing.

425
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,478
Fine.

426
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:59,521
Stupid... ethical

427
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,148
reasonable argument.

428
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,609
I wish you were a cake. Push you over.

429
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,068
Are you still muttering?

430
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,196
No! I stopped.

431
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:10,491
Stupid, good-hearing, reformed demon...

432
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,119
Wow.

433
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:15,996
Oh!

434
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,956
Hey there, Simone.

435
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,416
Shoving people in the pool, huh?

436
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,209
Yeah, just testing the laws of physics

437
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:22,843
here in my nonsense brain jail.

438
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:23,962
Who's this?

439
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,882
Uh, this is Chidi Anagonye.

440
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,676
He was a professor of
ethics and moral philosophy,

441
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
so I figured he might be able to help...

442
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,431
Chidi Anagonye, that sounds so familiar.

443
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:35,724
Where did you teach?

444
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,476
St. John's University in Sydney.

445
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:38,560
Of course!

446
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:39,978
I used to teach there.

447
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:41,187
I must've seen his name

448
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,148
on the faculty list and
now my dying brain

449
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,317
is just leaking out random information.

450
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:49,404

What's happening now?

455
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,875
When I was a kid, my CD alarm clock broke

456
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,793
and it used to wake me
up to that song every day,

457
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:06,588
so now I'm singing it to
try and wake myself up.

458
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,507
Okay, well, nice meeting you.

459
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,633

Hey...

464
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:20,942
You know,
it's bad enough you guys have taken over

465
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,103
my house for a year and I've had to move

466
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,238
into the attic, but now I have to walk in

467
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:26,984
to find Darth Vader's turd

468
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,568
in the middle of my living room.

469
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,987
I mean, what is this?

470
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:33,073
No time to explain.
Also, I kind of forgot.

471
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,909
Where is Derek's plunger?
The one that kills him.

472
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:37,619
Yeah, I used to do this whenever I needed

473
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:38,912
some alone time.

474
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,497
Once, I rebooted him

475
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,791
just because he was breathing super loud.

476
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,608
Then, when he woke up,
he was like, "I don't breathe."

477
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,963
So I don't know what I heard.
That was on me.

478
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,630
Well, I'm doing this because

479
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:50,757
he's trying to steal my girlfriend.

480
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,509
Yeah, you don't need to justify it.

481
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:55,720
Again, I do it all the time.

482
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,889
No, no, no, Mindy,
please wait, don't kill me!

483
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:00,517
Oh... it's you?

484
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,478
Okay, well,
you certainly don't have the Dereks to...

485
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,158
Yeah!

486
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:18,368
Oh, it's always good.

487
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:19,744
♪ Doo-do-do-doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

488
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,538
You know what, Simone?
Think of it this way.

489
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,289
If this is really all a hallucination,

490
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,459
doesn't it seem kind of basic?

491
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,752
I mean, surely,
your brain would imagine something

492
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,047
weirder than just a nice cocktail party?

493
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:31,465
Oh, you mean like that?

494
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:34,133
<i>Attention, I have been Dereked.</i>

495
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:37,179
That's probably my doctor.
I must be flat lining.

496
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,306
Oh, this is all in my head.

497
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:40,849
I'm gonna go eat a knife.

498
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,393
<i>Attention. Murder has been me.</i>

499
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,910
Let me get this straight:

500
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:47,731
Derek "made mean eyes at you,"

501
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:50,525
so you went to Mindy's
house and murdered him?

502
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,819
Yeah, dog, but his eyes were really mean.

503
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:56,073
You're probably thinking this,

504
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:59,158
but they were more like this...

505
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,994
Jason, why did you kill Derek?

506
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,121
I had to get his giant
head out of the sky

507
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,498
before any of the humans could see,
and it was not easy.

508
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:07,375
You have to push his plunger and his nose

509
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,044
at exactly the same time.

510
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,337
I was scared Derek was
trying to slide into your DMs.

511
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,214
I hate being scared. It's... it's scary.

512
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:14,465
I don't have time for this.

513
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,217
I am running a neighborhood
and its residents,

514
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,051
and Eleanor just casually orders me

515
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:19,346
to make popcorn rivers,

516
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:22,557
and Brent won't stop
calling me for stuff.

517
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,059
Ugh!

518
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:25,852
Are we still boyfriend-not-a-girlfriend?

519
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:27,396
We'll talk about it later.

520
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:30,023
Okay,
executive decision: Forget about Simone.

521
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,941
Janet,
make sure she doesn't come in contact

522
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:32,942
with the other humans.

523
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,444
Let's focus on Linda.

524
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,154
We ought to be able to figure her out

525
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:37,572
if we can just liven her up a bit.

526
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:38,907
We'll just, like, sprinkle some cocaine

527
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,116
on her peppermints or something.

528
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,160
Does anyone else find it suspicious

529
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,372
that the Bad Place sent someone so dull?

530
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,915
No, it makes perfect sense to me.

531
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,959
They are trying to drive us insane

532
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:52,004
by giving us a big boring
glob of plain yogurt.

533
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,631
Tomorrow morning,
we start Operation Linda.

534
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:56,508
Okay, you heard the lady.

535
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,760
We'll meet in the town
square bright and early.

536
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,263
- Janet, set up for Flying Day.
- Cool.

537
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,932
I'm not busy or anything,
so that'll be easy.

538
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,684
Off you go.

539
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:08,520
Whoo-hoo!

540
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:12,149
Ugh, being a parent is exhausting.

541
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,609
Never conjure 300 children
from the essence of your being.

542
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,320
You will have, like, zero free time.

543
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,907
Linda,
how are you enjoying the Good Place?

544
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,618
It's good.

545
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,203
Everyone's flying.

546
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,320
You don't want to go flying any higher?

547
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:29,290
No, thanks.

548
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:30,625
Oh, well, okay.

549
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,627
Says in your file that you like knitting.

550
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,837
Would you like to do
some knitting right now?

551
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,631
No, thanks.

552
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,716
Is there another activity
you'd like to do now?

553
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,763
You also enjoyed listening to birds.

554
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:46,308
Man, Linda, you don't even look at them?

555
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:49,561
Let's go hear some birds.
What do you say?

556
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,229
I'm gonna go get another peppermint.

557
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,647
Come on, Lins.

558
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:56,443
You can have literally
anything you could poss...

559
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,944
What the...

560
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,415
Okay, so...

561
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:12,532
Maybe she's less boring than I thought.

562
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:17,255
<i>So let me get this straight, Shawn:</i>

563
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,301
<i>You sent a demon in
disguise as one of the subjects?</i>

564
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,345
Yes, he did, Your Honor.

565
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,893
Luckily,
none of the other test subjects saw

566
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,145
the mess he made,

567
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,022
but he put the experiment at risk

568
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:36,358
and he attacked me and Eleanor.

569
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,819
And I'm sorry, where's your shirt?

570
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:40,653
I think it got stuck in the skin suit.

571
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,322
Well, keep it there.

572
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:43,865
<i>Damn it, Chris,</i>

573
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:45,575
<i>you were supposed to
slowly undermine them</i>

574
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,559
<i>and gradually sabotage the experiment,</i>

575
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,761
<i>not just go ham on day two,
you fart plume.</i>

576
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:51,873
I told you, I'm not an actor.

577
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,791
<i>And when you get back here,
you won't be anything.</i>

578
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,335
<i>Okay, fine, yes, busted.</i>

579
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:56,461
<i>I'm a rascal.</i>

580
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:57,879
<i>We'll come pick him up and replace him</i>

581
00:22:57,963 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>with an actual human.</i>

582
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,006
<i>Oh, you will do</i>

583
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,050
<i>nothing of the sort,</i> mon ami.

584
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:05,053
<i>This outrageous act must be punished.</i>

585
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,555
<i>Chidi will be the fourth
subject in this experiment.</i>

586
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,266
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

587
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,808
<i>He's perfect because he's already had</i>

588
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,018
<i>his memories erased.</i>

589
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,186
<i>Although you can't erase that booty,</i>

590
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,729
<i>know what I'm saying, blondie?</i>

591
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:17,231
All due respect, Your Honor,
keep it in your robe.

592
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,235
What she means is thank you,
Your Honor, we accept.

593
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:22,111
Chidi's gonna be our fourth subject.

594
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,654
<i>Chidi can't be part of the experiment.</i>

595
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:25,114
<i>They already know that he can improve.</i>

596
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,657
<i>That's like studying for a test,</i>

597
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:27,658
<i>then acing the test.</i>

598
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:28,618
<i>It's cheating.</i>

599
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:30,120
How is that cheating?

600
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,331
You're just falsely accusing
us of what you actually did.

601
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:34,707
<i>No, that's what you're doing.</i>

602
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,501
<i>Shawn, I don't have time for this.</i>

603
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,587
<i>I just started "Deadwood"... finally...</i>

604
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:41,673
<i>And I need my daily
dose of Timothy Olyphant,</i>

605
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,675
<i>so I'm gonna make this short.</i>

606
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:47,846
<i>If you so much as breathe
on this experiment again,</i>

607
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:51,308
<i>I will restart the entire
thing from scratch,</i>

608
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:55,103
<i>and then I will personally
rip off your eyelids</i>

609
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,230
<i>and make you watch heartwarming videos</i>

610
00:23:57,397 --> 00:23:59,941
<i>of soldiers coming home to their dogs.</i>

611
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:03,236
<i>Good news: The other four humans</i>

612
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:04,821
were having so much fun flying,

613
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:06,155
they didn't see people
being punched out of the sky.

614
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,616
Come on.

615
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,619
Getting Chidi to be one
of the four test subjects,

616
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,162
that's a huge win.

617
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:14,539
But it doesn't feel like it.
It feels like we got lucky.

618
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:15,916
And punched in the face.

619
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:18,418
We also got punched in the face.

620
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,587
Whoa, slow down.

621
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,091
Did you put those trash cans there

622
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:26,509
just so you could crash into them?

623
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,803
That wasn't my fault, I was texting.

624
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,388
Okay, let him go, dung buckets.

625
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:31,932
Nice try.

626
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:35,935
We'll put him on the train
and handcuff him to a bench.

627
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,603
Yeah, forgive us if we don't trust you

628
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,856
not to cheat again.

629
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,649
Surprised you figured
out that Linda was a fake,

630
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:44,611
because we all thought
you were too stupid.

631
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:47,613
Well,
it was actually Tahani who got suspicious.

632
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:51,076
Aww... that is so embarrassing for you.

633
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:53,370
Seems like you're
royally forking this up,

634
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:54,912
just like we knew you would.

635
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,998
Okay, take off,

636
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,749
and give Shawn a message for me.

637
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,295
Tell him that we said, "Boo-yah!"

638
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:03,629
Make sure you do the hand motion.

639
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,966
Like, "Boo-yah!" Are you listening to me?

640
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:07,717
- Okay, Michael, that's fine.
- No, show me...

641
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,010
- Show me how you're gonna do it.
- That's fine.

642
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:10,720
No, it's important that
she does the hand thing,

643
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:12,754
'cause it really drives the point home.
